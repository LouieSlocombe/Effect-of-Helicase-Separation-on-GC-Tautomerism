## Molecular dynamics files

The following files can be used to reproduce molecular dynamics files in Gromacs 2018 with the CHARMM36 and SPCE force fields:

- DNA14_rdy.gro (Solvated and neutralised double stranded DNA with 14 basepairs)
- min.mdp (minimisation control file)
- eq500ps_dna.mdp (equilibration NVT control file)
- md200ps_dna_pull90min.mdp (example SMD control file)
